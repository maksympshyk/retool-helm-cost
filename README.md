To ensure a better user experience when deploying on Helm, we have made important updates to the Helm deployment instructions. The deployment instructions have been migrated to an [official deployment guide](https://docs.retool.com/docs/deploy-with-helm), hosted on [docs.retool.com](https://docs.retool.com/docs/deploy-with-helm). The new guide provides more comprehensive set of deployment instructions with the goal of improving the deployment experience for our users.

This repository contains the official **Helm 3** chart for Retool. This chart is maintained by the Retool team.

For any inquiries regarding this chart, or Retool in general, our team is here to assist you. Please feel free to reach out to us at support@retool.com with any questions or concerns.
